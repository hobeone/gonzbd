// the rule here rather than "the ones this caller happens to care about".
//
// It preserves the relative order of the remaining entries: queue order is
// the priority policy sched consults, and a swap-with-last deletion would
// silently reorder jobs behind the removed one. evictCancelledNeverRun
// (tick.go) is the first caller — it never removes a running job, but this
// method makes no such assumption itself.
//
// What each prune buys, since none of them is obviously load-bearing on its
// own and all three were omitted at least once:
//
//   - d.written: a job removed from the registry would keep its last-Persisted
//     entry forever, and a reused job ID's first persistIfChanged would
//     compare against the dead job's stale row and wrongly suppress a Save.
//   - d.resident: a stale true entry makes reconcileResidency take neither
//     branch (its hydrate arm requires !d.isResident(id)), so a reused ID
//     never hydrates and runs without its manifest.
//   - d.launched: a stale true entry makes claimLaunched return false
//     forever, so a reused ID is permanently unlaunchable.
